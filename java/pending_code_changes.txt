Code changes:
 - Deleting deprecated methods in ShortNumberInfo that work on strings, instead
   of phone number objects. These have been marked deprecated for months. Any
   users of these methods should call PhoneNumberUtil.parse first to create a
   PhoneNumber object, and pass this in.
 - Support semicolon as extension character while parsing phone numbers. This
   is not applicable when you are trying to find the phone numbers.
